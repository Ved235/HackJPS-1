# Ohm's Law Simulator

## Overview

Welcome to the Ohm's Law Simulator! This project was created for the HackJPS 2024 hackathon, specifically for the track: "Lab Simulation"
Our simulator focuses on Ohm's Law a concept in physics that relates voltage, current and resistance. This tool helps students understand and experiment with Ohm's Law in an interactive and engaging way, making remote learning more effective and enjoyable.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Adjust the voltage and observe changes in current using a virtual ammeter and voltmeter.
- **Dynamic Charting**: Plot and visualize data points on a real-time graph using Chart.js.
- **User Inputs**: Manually input data points to see their effect on the graph.
- **Guided Experiment**: Step-by-step instructions and hints to help students learn and experiment with Ohm's Law.

## How to Use

1. **Home Page**:
   - Adjust the voltage using the slider and see the current change accordingly.
   - The ammeter and voltmeter display real-time values.
   - Add data points to the graph by entering values and clicking "Add DataPoint & Render".
   - Remove points as needed using the "Remove Point" button.
   - Click the "Hint" button for guidance.

2. **Series Page**:
   - Access additional resources and information about series circuits.
3. **Parallel Page**
   - Access additional resources and information about parallel circuits.
## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: Chart.js for graph plotting, SweetAlert2 for interactive alerts
- **No build tools required**: Simply open the HTML files in your browser to use the simulator.



## Installation and Setup

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ojas2000/HackJPS.git
   cd HackJPS
   ```
